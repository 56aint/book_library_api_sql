# MySQL Book Library API

This repository contains the integration test suite for Book Library API challenge.
It has been created as an `express` app which uses `sequelize` to interact with `MYSQL` database.

## Getting Started
Create a new directory on your computer `mkdir 'your folder name'`
```bash
fork the repo
git clone git@github.com:56aint/book_library_api_sql.git your-project-folder-name
cd into your-project-folder-name
npm install
```
*```runinng npm install``` as above should provide all the needed peer dependencies, but the following explanation & instructions guides through how this project has been acheived, and steps to individual peer dependency installation are included too.*

## NEXT >>> Set up your database
It is assumed that you have MYSQL running in a docker;
Install docker with: 
```sudo apt install docker.io```
Check  if docker is installed 
```docker --version```

You can set up a MYSQL image in a docker by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name book_library_api_sql -e 
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> mysql
**keep the password safe**
``` 
Now that you have a container for your book-library,
**wake it up!** run:
```bash
docker start book_library_api_sql
```
***anytime you shutdown your computer, you have to wake the container up again when your computer is turned on, and to stop your docker container at anytime, run:
```bash
docker stop book_library_api_sql
```
**We can use MYSQL workbench to connect to our databse directly. To install MYSQL workbench, run:
```bash
sudo apt install mysql-workbench
```
Once you started your book-library, run:
```bash
docker exec -it book_library_api_sql bash
```

```bash
mysql -uroot -p
***Enter the password you kept safe***
show databases;
```
To exit MYSQL workbench run:
```bash
exit
```
To exit book-library-api-db container, run:
```bash
exit
```
The container will be running underground until your computer is shutdown or you stopped it. 

***NOTE** The database will be automatically created by ```sequelize``` using  a 'script' in our project folder, which will use nodemon to execute 'index.js' with the environment variables loaded from '.env' file(stay tuned), so at the moment, when you run: `show databases;`, your workbench is empty.

**The command to manually create the database is: `CREATE DATABASE book_library_api_sql` which is run before `show databases;`**


## NEXT >>> Set up your local environment files and project folder/files
Create a ```scripts``` folder, containing **```create-database.js``` and ```drop-database.js```** files
In your terminal, run:
```bash
npm install --save mysql2
```
-Create ```.env``` file.
-Create a folder a folder inside ```src``` folder named ```models```  containing ```index.js``` file
 -require sequelize at the top of this ```index.js``` file.
 -declare
```bash
  const { DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_HOST, DB_PORT,} = process.env;
```
 -declare a function named setupDatabase
 -declare a const and assign a new Sequelize() to it. Pass it the connection infomation from your ```.env```
 -call sequelize.sync({alter: true}), have the function return an ```Empty object```
 -and module.exports = setupDatabase() at the bottom.


In our package.json file, there is ```prestart``` script that uses node to create database(if not already been created manually as above). Node uses 'create-database.js' file to create the database by loading the variables saved in our **'.env'** file. The variables in ```.env``` file are;
```bash
    DB_NAME=<book_library_api_sql> 
    DB_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> 
    DB_USER=root
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=3306
```
If everything has been done correctly running ```npm start``` in your terminal should land us on our project root ```index.js```:
 *Now serving your Express app at http://localhost:3000`*

I got the following error message the last time, which was due to my port being busy with the last project
```bash
code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: -98,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '::',
  port: 3000
```
I terminated all the running processes with ```killall node``` and everything was fine.


## NEXT >>> Set up your Test Environment
-Install these as dependencies;
 -mocha ```npm install --save-dev mocha```
 -chai ```npm install chai```
 -supertest ```npm install supertest --save-dev```

-Create a folder at the project root called ```test-setup.js```
-Add a .env.test with the same environment variables as your .env. Make sure to give your test
 database a different name.
```bash
    DB_NAME=<book_library_api_sql-test>
    DB_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> 
    DB_USER=root
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=3306
```
-In our package.json, there is a pretest script with the command: ```node scripts/create-database.js test```. The test option at the end of the command tells the script to load the variables from .env.test instead of .env.
-There is also a posttest script in our package.json with the command: ```node scripts/drop-database.js```. This will use **```drop-database.js```** file in our **scripts** folder to delete our test database after our tests have finished running.

**Reminder** In src folder, create these folders in order listed: Model, Controller, Routes, tests. The first folder will be required in the next, and so on.
Also, associations are made in Sequelize setup file e.g. in /src/models/index.js

## Interacting With This API
Some of us do not have the time to follow the above steps. You can interact with this API by sending Create, Get, Update or Delete (CRUD) requests. e.g
 -Create: 
 POST /authors
 {
	"author": "David Baldacci",
}
-POST /genres
{
	"genre": "Thriller"
}
-POST /books
{
	"title": "Memory Man",
	"AuthorId": 1,
	"GenreId": 1
}

-Read: GET /books
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Memory Man",
        "ISBN": "123-4-56-789000-0",
        "createdAt": "2020-06-08T12:59:32.000Z",
        "updatedAt": "2020-06-08T13:14:17.000Z",
        "GenreId": 1,
        "AuthorId": 1,
        "Genre": {
            "id": 1,
            "genre": "Thriller",
            "createdAt": "2020-06-08T12:57:05.000Z",
            "updatedAt": "2020-06-08T12:57:05.000Z"
        },
        "Author": {
            "id": 1,
            "author": "David Baldacci",
            "createdAt": "2020-06-08T13:04:55.000Z",
            "updatedAt": "2020-06-08T13:04:55.000Z"
        }
    }
]
